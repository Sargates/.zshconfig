## Info
This is my terminal config. Complete with personalized tools, aliases, and OMZ theme. \
Configured to work in both WSL and native Linux with integrated keyboard selection similar to browsers and text editors. \
Feel free to disect it and scrutinize.


This configuration is for a zsh terminal. It requires ZSH to be installed, 

## Requirements
Requires packages to be installed: `zsh`, oh-my-zsh, `git`.
> **:pencil: Note:** For oh-my-zsh, the default directory of `~/oh-my-zsh/` will work, otherwise modify the value of `$ZSH` in `.zshrc`

## Installation (WIP)
Installation script is currently very outdated and probably doesn't work

<!--
